</span>“In days long past, shortly after Eltara had become the heart of the universe, numerous portals to other worlds and
times opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first creatures
to come through the gates raided the world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Seers and Speakers ended their war to unite against the raiders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Together they successfully fended off raiders from many different realms
and dimensions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the
Myrae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Myrae had heard of the
magical abilities of the Seers and Speakers and sought to have it for themselves
to enhance their own natural abilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
began kidnapping all the sorcerers, trying to force their magical abilities from
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When that didn’t work, they
tried breeding with them, to try to take back with them children who could wield
magic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That, too, was unsuccessful,
and many children died at the hands of the Myrae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rituals the Myrae used to try to steal magical ability almost always
ended in the death of the magic user.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Seers and Speakers opened a portal to an isolated dimension and many fled there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lioryn was grieved to see her children slaughtered, and withdrew deep
within Eltara, taking all magic with her to prevent any more deaths. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>For
two more generations the Myrae sought and destroyed all who were reported to
manipulate magic.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“When the
Myrae finally withdrew, believing they had eradicated all magic on Eltara since
they themselves could not have it, the Seers and Speakers who were left, along
with the half breed children left behind, tried to rebuild a life for
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon the children saw the grief their presence caused the
Seers and Speakers and they left their homes to form their own tribe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They called themselves humans and over the next ten generations, they
homogenized into a distinct race.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gone
was the Sight of the Seers, gone was the telepathy of the Speakers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They gradually lost the third eye of the Seers, the skin-ribbons of the
Speakers, and the monstrous size of the Myrae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But for all they had lost, they developed a trait all their own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They became adaptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
blood of the Seers and Speakers in them mingled with the magic of the Myrae to
allow them to take on aspects of other creatures through ritual.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some chose the amphibious lungs of lizards, some chose the long claws of
wildcats, some chose the powerful noses of the dogs.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Monotype Corsiva"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“The humans
preferred to think of themselves as Eltara’s third native race, equal to the
Seers and Speakers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as other races came to Eltara, they learned that they
could imitate them also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so was
born the race known as human, with their talent for adaptability.”<o:p>
