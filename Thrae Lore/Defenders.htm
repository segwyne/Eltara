</span>“Gather ‘round and I shall relate to you the tale of how all the
peoples of Eltara came together to protect her, and how the Trolls came to be
self-appointed guardians of this world.</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“And so it
was that the Myrae came again to Eltara.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
came to find their children, and also to harvest the natural aspects of Eltara’s peoples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rapidly, the choice was made to gather with the other races
and fight as one against the Myrae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the ranks, the heroes rose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each
hero a different race, each bringing a different talent to use against the foe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ours was known as Meldira the Invincible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She stood with her army, along with the others – Elves and Seers,
Speakers and Dwarves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the
children of the Myrae, those who they wished to use against us, stood by our
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally came the animals, the lizard-kin, the cat-like
Felinorians, and their mortal enemies, the Canioriens.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“With the
rising of the sun, that which is now known as the Great Battle began.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For many days we fought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
days turned into weeks, the weeks into months, the death tolls mounting into the
thousands on both sides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
this time, one generation died and another was born to replace it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was then that the tide turned, the strength of the new generation
feeding it, and we began to push back the enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some call it the Great Day, others the Last Day, it was the
day of endings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The war raged in a
place now called the Lost Heroes Valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forced
into retreat, the Myrae entered what they thought was a pass to safety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They wished to escape and regroup as night fell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The battle began to slow, the wounded were collected, the dead were
honored, defenses were set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
came a voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She spoke the words
of peace, the melodious tones flowed as if they were the air itself.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“’Together
you have come,’ she said, ‘to do battle for my safety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this you will all prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fear
not your enemy any longer, for you have driven them from me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rest now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon the
rebuilding will begin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your cities
and your people will grow and be well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
have brought peace to Eltara and in doing so, brought peace to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sleep now, rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None
shall need fear the night.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
as her words drifted on the wind, we lay down and slept.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Awakening,
we found our heroes together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
naked and unarmed bodies lay connected in a circle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Within the circle we found their oath – ‘To you, Lioryn, we give our
spirits, to call upon when you have need.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When you need us, we shall be born again to take up arms in your defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This we do so swear.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
a day of mourning and preparing the heroes for burial, we again arose, finding
this time, their bodies gone as well.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“As we began
our slow, grief-filled travels home, we the Trolls stood at the edge of the
valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As if of one mind, we again
spoke words of oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘We the
children and our children’s children do swear to honor the heroes, to fight
beside them against any foe wishing to claim our home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As this planet once saved us, so do we swear to repay that debt now and
for always.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall stand guard
against the continuing threat of invaders as the first line of defense and never
again allow an enemy to attack us unawares.’<o:p>
</o:p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>“And so the heroes sacrificed their lives, and the Trolls devoted
theirs to the continuing safety of Eltara and all her people.”</font></font></span>
