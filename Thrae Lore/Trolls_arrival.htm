<p class="MsoNormal" style="" align="left"><font color="#333333" size="5"><span style="font-family: Celtic;">The
Coming of the Trolls<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“So you wish
to hear how my people the Trolls came to Eltara?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, pull up a chair, my friend, and I shall tell you.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Once we
lived on a planet known as Kalarmin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
we prospered as a great civilization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had many museums, libraries and universities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The center of this once great empire was our capital, Shalmar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There people would come to study the arts, music, and
literature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here people would
gather to do business, bringing wares to the market, hiring soldiers to help aid
in travel of caravans.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“But all was
not at peace within Shalmar or on Kalarmin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We warred with a race known to us as Shiroi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were a large empire and growing rapidly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We began to extend our boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
became angry with this and fought back by raiding our villages and supplies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Shiroi possessed one thing that we did not – magic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To guarantee our safety when attacking we used swift, brutal assaults,
destroying all we could as quickly as we could.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Victory after victory was ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
gained land and goods to supply our ever-growing population.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Shiroi, however, began to realize what we were doing and so banded
together against us in a massive army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
new campaign against us, led by a powerful wizard, they began to take back that
which we had taken from them and more.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Just as it
seemed the Shiroi were going to conquer Shalmar, a people came to us called the
Myrae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They approached our leaders,
offering help, and in return they required only knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Myrae claimed they could destroy the Shiroi, totally eliminating them
from our planet.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“As promised,
the Shiroi were destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I
remember, it was about a year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Myrae returned to collect their knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our governor Lorim swung open the doors of our great libraries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Myrae declined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
offered them the keys to our universities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still they said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked
them, ‘What knowledge, then, do you seek?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is it we have that you desire?’<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“’That
which we seek lies within you.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Myrae then reached and grabbed Lorim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lorim
shrank to the ground clutching his belly and head, screaming in agony and pain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other Myrae picked him up, carrying him away, their last words, ‘We
have begun collecting on our debt,’ echoing through the now silent hall.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Overnight it
seemed our once beautiful city was abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We took our families and belongings and fled into the forests and
mountains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For months and months we moved from place to place, hunted as
a fox by the hound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our deceivers,
the Myrae, picked us off slowly, taking small groups at a time, stealing that
which was gifted us, our very essence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
time, some of our people felt drawn to a place unfamiliar to us, yet promising
safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would dream of this
place and led us unerringly towards swampy bog lands.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“As more and
more arrived, our leaders gathered to find out what had happened to the others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stories came of the Shiroi found by other wandering groups.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They said the Shiroi bodies were found twisted in agony, their faces held
looks of utter horror as they realized their own tortured death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite all of our knowledge, it seemed we had truly been the fools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amends needed, the decision was made and an oath written.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Never again would we actively seek to destroy another, nor would we allow
another to fool us into our own destruction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here we would stand, defending it to the last.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None would take it from us.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="CAC Krazy Legs"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Gathering at
dawn, we the people began to speak the words.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The light of the sun began to flicker as if in response to our vows.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A chill swept the mass, our bodies shook and quivered, the power of our
words controlling our spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
oath sworn, we began to build defenses for our haven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within days we realized, however, that the land around us had
changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No longer were we on our
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The safety we sought had
brought us to it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>

<font face="CAC Krazy Legs" size="3">“And
so we migrated to the land known as Eltara, to live here and make amends for our
foolishness.”<br style="page-break-before: always;" clear="all">
