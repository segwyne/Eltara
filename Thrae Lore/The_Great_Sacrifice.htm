Well sit back, and I shall tell you her sad tale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thousands of years ago, there were but two races on Eltara, the
Seers and the Speakers. Each worshipped their own gods and they warred
amongst themselves, using religion to fuel the fires of hate. Millions
of people died in the bloody name of righteousness and still the
battles raged. It was genocide. The two races were nearly eradicated
before someone figured out how to stop it.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Copperplate T, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Book Antiqua"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“A
well-intentioned man, well versed in the ways of magic, blamed the gods
for the war. He believed that if the gods were gone, the war would end
and the loss of life could be stopped. For years he studied ancient
tomes and texts, searching for some way to overcome the gods.<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Copperplate T, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Book Antiqua"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“After
20 years, he finally determined he had enough knowledge to bottle them
forever. He collected all his tools and, with the assistance of his
wife Lioryn, began his ritual on a night of great power. It was a long
and arduous night, and as he neared the end he was fatigued. As he
struggled through the complex words of power, his tongue fumbled and he
misspoke a key word. The gods seized the moment, and stole his wife.
The result was that the gods were not bottled, but trapped his wife’s
spirit in the earth itself. The planet was hurtled across the universe
away from the gods, and so his work was in a way successful. He was so
engrossed in his work that he did not notice anything amiss until he
was done and it was too late.<o:p>
