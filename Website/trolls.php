<h1>The Coming of the Trolls</h1>
<div class="article">
<p>So you wish to hear how my people the Trolls came to Eltara?  Well, pull up a chair, my friend, and I shall tell you.</p>

<p>Once we lived on a planet known as Kalarmin.  There we prospered as a great civilization.  We had many museums, libraries and universities.  The center of this once great empire was our capital, Shalmar.  There people would come to study the arts, music, and literature.  Here people would gather to do business, bringing wares to the market, hiring soldiers to help aid in travel of caravans.</p>

<p>But all was not at peace within Shalmar or on Kalarmin.  We warred with a race known to us as Shiroi.  We were a large empire and growing rapidly.  We began to extend our boundaries.  They became angry with this and fought back by raiding our villages and supplies.  The Shiroi possessed one thing that we did not – magic.  To guarantee our safety when attacking we used swift, brutal assaults, destroying all we could as quickly as we could.  Victory after victory was ours.  We gained land and goods to supply our ever-growing population.  The Shiroi, however, began to realize what we were doing and so banded together against us in a massive army.  Their new campaign against us, led by a powerful wizard, they began to take back that which we had taken from them and more.</p>

<p>Just as it seemed the Shiroi were going to conquer Shalmar, a people came to us called the Myrae.  They approached our leaders, offering help, and in return they required only knowledge.  The Myrae claimed they could destroy the Shiroi, totally eliminating them from our planet.</p>

<p>As promised, the Shiroi were destroyed.  If I remember, it was about a year.  The Myrae returned to collect their knowledge.  Our governor Lorim swung open the doors of our great libraries.  The Myrae declined.  He offered them the keys to our universities.  Still they said no.  He asked them, ‘What knowledge, then, do you seek?  What is it we have that you desire?’</p>

<p>’That which we seek lies within you.’  The Myrae then reached and grabbed Lorim.  Lorim shrank to the ground clutching his belly and head, screaming in agony and pain.  The other Myrae picked him up, carrying him away, their last words, ‘We have begun collecting on our debt,’ echoing through the now silent hall.</p>

<p>Overnight it seemed our once beautiful city was abandoned.  We took our families and belongings and fled into the forests and mountains.  For months and months we moved from place to place, hunted as a fox by the hound.  Our deceivers, the Myrae, picked us off slowly, taking small groups at a time, stealing that which was gifted us, our very essence.  In time, some of our people felt drawn to a place unfamiliar to us, yet promising safety.  They would dream of this place and led us unerringly towards swampy bog lands.</p>

<p>As more and more arrived, our leaders gathered to find out what had happened to the others.  Stories came of the Shiroi found by other wandering groups.  They said the Shiroi bodies were found twisted in agony, their faces held looks of utter horror as they realized their own tortured death.  Despite all of our knowledge, it seemed we had truly been the fools.  Amends needed, the decision was made and an oath written.  Never again would we actively seek to destroy another, nor would we allow another to fool us into our own destruction.  Here we would stand, defending it to the last.  None would take it from us.</p>

<p>Gathering at dawn, we the people began to speak the words.  The light of the sun began to flicker as if in response to our vows.  A chill swept the mass, our bodies shook and quivered, the power of our words controlling our spirit.  The oath sworn, we began to build defenses for our haven.  Within days we realized, however, that the land around us had changed.  No longer were we on our home.  The safety we sought had brought us to it.</p>

<p>And so we migrated to the land known as Eltara, to live here and make amends for our foolishness.</p>
