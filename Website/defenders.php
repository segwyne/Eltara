<h1>Defenders of Eltara</h1>
<div class="article">
<p>Gather ‘round and I shall relate to you the tale of how all the peoples of Eltara came together to protect her, and how the Trolls came to be self-appointed guardians of this world.</p>

<p>And so it was that the Myrae came again to Eltara.  They came to find their children, and also to harvest the natural aspects of Eltara’s peoples.  Rapidly, the choice was made to gather with the other races and fight as one against the Myrae.  From the ranks, the heroes rose.  Each hero a different race, each bringing a different talent to use against the foe.  Ours was known as Meldira the Invincible.  She stood with her army, along with the others – Elves and Seers, Speakers and Dwarves.  Even the children of the Myrae, those who they wished to use against us, stood by our side.  Finally came the animals, the lizard-kin, the cat-like Felinorians, and their mortal enemies, the Canioriens.</p>

<p>With the rising of the sun, that which is now known as the Great Battle began.  For many days we fought.  Those days turned into weeks, the weeks into months, the death tolls mounting into the thousands on both sides.  During this time, one generation died and another was born to replace it.  It was then that the tide turned, the strength of the new generation feeding it, and we began to push back the enemy.  Some call it the Great Day, others the Last Day, it was the day of endings.  The war raged in a place now called the Lost Heroes Valley.  Forced into retreat, the Myrae entered what they thought was a pass to safety.  They wished to escape and regroup as night fell.  The battle began to slow, the wounded were collected, the dead were honored, defenses were set.  There came a voice.  She spoke the words of peace, the melodious tones flowed as if they were the air itself.</p>

<p>’Together you have come,’ she said, ‘to do battle for my safety.  For this you will all prosper.  Fear not your enemy any longer, for you have driven them from me.  Rest now.  Soon the rebuilding will begin.  Your cities and your people will grow and be well.  You have brought peace to Eltara and in doing so, brought peace to me.  Sleep now, rest.  None shall need fear the night.’  And as her words drifted on the wind, we lay down and slept.</p>

<p>Awakening, we found our heroes together.  Their naked and unarmed bodies lay connected in a circle.  Within the circle we found their oath – ‘To you, Lioryn, we give our spirits, to call upon when you have need.   When you need us, we shall be born again to take up arms in your defense.  This we do so swear.’  After a day of mourning and preparing the heroes for burial, we again arose, finding this time, their bodies gone as well.</p>

<p>As we began our slow, grief-filled travels home, we the Trolls stood at the edge of the valley.  As if of one mind, we again spoke words of oath.  ‘We the children and our children’s children do swear to honor the heroes, to fight beside them against any foe wishing to claim our home.  As this planet once saved us, so do we swear to repay that debt now and for always.  We shall stand guard against the continuing threat of invaders as the first line of defense and never again allow an enemy to attack us unawares.’</p>

<p>And so the heroes sacrificed their lives, and the Trolls devoted theirs to the continuing safety of Eltara and all her people.”</p>
