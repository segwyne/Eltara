<h1>The Great Sacrifice</h1>
<div class="article">
<p>So you wish to know how the world came to be what she is, eh? Well sit back, and I shall tell you her sad tale.  Thousands of years ago, there were but two races on Eltara, the Seers and the Speakers. Each worshipped their own gods and they warred amongst themselves, using religion to fuel the fires of hate. Millions of people died in the bloody name of righteousness and still the battles raged. It was genocide. The two races were nearly eradicated before someone figured out how to stop it.</p>

<p>A well-intentioned man, well versed in the ways of magic, blamed the gods for the war. He believed that if the gods were gone, the war would end and the loss of life could be stopped. For years he studied ancient tomes and texts, searching for some way to overcome the gods.</p>

<p>After 20 years, he finally determined he had enough knowledge to bottle them forever. He collected all his tools and, with the assistance of his wife Lioryn, began his ritual on a night of great power. It was a long and arduous night, and as he neared the end he was fatigued. As he struggled through the complex words of power, his tongue fumbled and he misspoke a key word. The gods seized the moment, and stole his wife. The result was that the gods were not bottled, but trapped his wifeâ€™s spirit in the earth itself. The planet was hurtled across the universe away from the gods, and so his work was in a way successful. He was so engrossed in his work that he did not notice anything amiss until he was done and it was too late.</p>

<p>Lioryn was trapped within the planet and gave it life and sentience. She learned how to control the magic of the planet to a slight degree.</p>
